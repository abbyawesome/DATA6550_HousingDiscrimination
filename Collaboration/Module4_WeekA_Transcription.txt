How does everyone pair? Pretty good. You're pretty good. I'm good. Yep.

Housing discrimination. Oh, sorry. Were you gonna say something, Abby? Oh, I was just gonna read through what we decided. Oh, just real quick so it's written down.

Yeah. Cool. So Steven is going to be taking Ramsey County. I, Abby, am taking initial analysis. Charles is taking data bias.

Miracle is taking algorithmic bias, and our next meeting is March 19 at 7PM. Yes. Perfect. Listen in? Yeah.

Thank you all.
